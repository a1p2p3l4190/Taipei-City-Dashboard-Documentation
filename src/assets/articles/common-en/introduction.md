## About Taipei City Dashboard

Taipei City Dashboard is a data visualization platform developed by Taipei Urban Intelligence Center (TUIC).

Our main goal is to create a comprehensive data visualization tool to assist in Taipei City policy decisions. This was achieved through the first version of the Taipei City Dashboard, which displayed a mix of internal and open data, seamlessly blending statistical and geographical data.

Since its launch in 2021, Taipei City Dashboard has played an important role in assisting Taipei City government officials in making informed policy decisions. Learn more about how the idea for Taipei City Dashboard was developed and refined in [this article](https://tuic.gov.taipei/en/works/dashboard) on TUIC’s website.

## Why City Dashboard

Taipei City Dashboard’s comprehensive yet simple and straightforward design sets it apart from similar data visualization platforms. It was built with the intent of encouraging cross-referencing across time and space, organizing datasets into modularized and integrated visual components.

Most of the data displayed in Taipei City Dashboard is from [data.taipei](https://data.taipei/), Taipei’s open data platform. We have provided data interpretation guides and suggested use cases for each dataset on the platform, allowing any user to fully leverage the possibilities of Taipei open data.

Taipei City Dashboard is the first open-sourced dashboard that is not just for public showcasing. We have not only made the codebase for the platform public but also actively encourage collaboration in the development effort.

Whether you want to contribute to improving Taipei or New Taipei's open data ecosystem or create your own data visualization tool, Taipei City Dashboard is a great place to start and build upon.

## Our Dashboard, Made Yours

Fast forward to mid-2023, as Taipei City’s open data ecosystem matured and expanded, our vision gradually expanded as well. We aimed not only to aid policy decisions but also to keep citizens informed about the important statistics of their city. Given the effectiveness of this tool, we also hoped to publicize the codebase for this project so that any relevant organization could easily create a similar data visualization tool of their own.

Our dashboard, made yours.

### Taipei City Dashboard 2.0

Based on the above vision, we decided to begin development on Taipei City Dashboard 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 has become a public platform instead of just an internal tool. The codebase for Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 is open-source, inviting all interested parties to participate in the development of this platform.

We have completed the front-end and back-end development of Taipei City Dashboard 2.0. You can suggest features and modifications to Taipei City Dashboard 2.0, and develop the platform together with us.

### Taipei City Dashboard 3.0

As the platform grows and user needs evolve, we are excited to introduce Taipei City Dashboard version 3.0. The most significant change in this update is that our vision is no longer limited to a single city, but expands to a broader geographical scope.

The original "Taipei City Dashboard" has now evolved into a multi-city dashboard framework, and for the first time includes a "Taipei and New Taipei Dashboard" feature, integrating important data from Taipei City and New Taipei City to provide a cross-city comprehensive analytical perspective. This is our first step towards integrating data from all of Taiwan.

Our vision is to gradually incorporate data from all counties and cities across Taiwan, establishing a complete city data platform that allows users to compare development indicators of different cities, understand regional trends, and gain more comprehensive data insights.

Taipei City Dashboard 3.0 is not just a presentation of data, but also a microcosm of Taiwan's open data ecosystem. We invite local governments, civic organizations, and data enthusiasts to participate together, making Taipei City Dashboard an important cornerstone for Taiwan's urban governance and data applications.

We look forward to you exploring Taipei City Dashboard 3.0 and joining us in building a more comprehensive city data platform!
