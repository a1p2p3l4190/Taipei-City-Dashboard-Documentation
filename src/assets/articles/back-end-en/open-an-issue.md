## Overview

Any new development on this project starts with an issue. To open an issue, navigate to the issues tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/tpe-doit/Taipei-City-Dashboard/issues/new/choose) and choose one of the three issue types. For an issue to be considered, the issue template for that type of request must be filled out in full. Issues that do not provide clear guidance or descriptions may be immediately closed as not actionable.

We recommend waiting for your issue to be approved before starting development. This is because all pull requests need to resolve at least one approved issue to be considered. The approval criteria for each issue type are explained below.

> **w01**
> If your issue is approved and you would like to work on it yourself, remember to fork the repository and work on any changes in your own repository. Do not clone the repository as non-collaborators don’t have direct push access to the official repository.

## Bug Fix Request

If any functionalities in this project don’t work as you expect, you should open a bug fix request.

As long as the template is filled out in full and the bug is confirmed to exist, the issue will be approved to be worked on.

## New Feature Request

If you would like to add new functionalities such as new APIs, you should open a new feature request.

New features should only be added if there are no existing solutions in the project and it will add significant value to the application.
