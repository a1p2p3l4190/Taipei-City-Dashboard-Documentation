## Overview

Components are collections of data that make up dashboards. All components, contain statistical data that can be displayed in a chart or graphical form. Components can also optionally contain geographical and historical data.

## Component Configuration

Each component has three identifying attributes: Index, ID, and City. Among these, Index is a unique identification code, a distinct English string that facilitates identification of component content; ID represents the data type number, with the same type of data across different cities sharing the same ID; and City indicates the source city of the data. Components with the same ID share the same name and chart_config settings, ensuring consistent presentation of cross-city data. Component configurations (Object) are returned in an array. The complete list of parameters can be found below.

> **i01**
> All components have statistical data and a chart configuration object should be included in the component configuration. The chart configuration object will be explained in greater detail in [this later article](/front-end/supported-chart-types#chart-config).

> **i02**
> If the component has geographical data, pass in a map configuration object. If not, pass in `null`. The map configuration object will be explained in greater detail in [this later article](/front-end/supported-map-types#map-config).

> **i03**
> Pass in a map filter configuration object to support map filtering via charts. If not, pass in `null`. The map filter configuration object will be explained in greater detail in [this later article](/front-end/map-filtering).

> **i04**
> If the component has historical data, pass in a historical data configuration object. If not, pass in `null`. The historical data configuration object will be explained in greater detail in [this later article](/front-end/history-data).

> **i05**
> For components that display static or demo data, pass in `static` or `demo`. For components that display the newest data available, pass in `current`. For components that display data since a certain time ago, pass in `day_ago`, `week_ago`, `month_ago`, `quarter_ago`, `halfyear_ago`, `year_ago`, `twoyear_ago`, `fiveyear_ago`, `tenyear_ago`, or `max`. For components that display data since the beginning of a certain time, pass in `day_start`, `week_start`, `month_start`, `quarter_start` or `year_start`.

> The application will calculate the specific dates and times to query the back-end for data.

> **i06**
> All general components have a city field that identifies the source city of the component data, which is an important identifying attribute in multi-city dashboards. Currently supported values include: `taipei`: Taipei City data, `metrotaipei`: integrated data for both Taipei and New Taipei City
>
> Components with the same ID share the same name and chart_config settings across different cities, but the data sources and content will vary according to the city. The range of supported cities will continue to be expanded in the future, while maintaining the consistency of the component structure.
