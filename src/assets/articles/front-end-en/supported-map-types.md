## Map Config

This project supports more than one map for each component. As such, the `map_config` parameter in the component configuration takes an array of map config objects, with each map config representing one map. When a component is expanded in the map view, all maps attached to that component will be rendered simultaneously.

The complete map config object can be found below.

```json
"map_config": [
    {
        // String; must be unique and the same as the map data file name
        "index": "socl_welfare",
        // Object; supports all Mapbox paint properties. See 1st info box below for details.
        "paint": {
            "fill-color": [] // See 1st warning box for details.
        },
        "property": [
	        // key: String; a property name in the map data
	        // name: String; Display name in the user interface
			// mode: "video" || null; whether to embed a video or image
            { "key": "vil", "name": "里界" },
            { "key": "cnt_low_income", "name": "低收入人口數" },
			{ "key": "video_url", "name": "影片連結", "mode": "video"}
        ], // Array of Objects; properties to show in map popup
        "title": "社福人口", // String; map name
        "type": "fill", // String; pass in 1 of the 8 available map types
        "size": null, // String || null; additional preset style setting. See next section.
        "icon": null, // String || null; additional preset style setting. See next section
		"source": "raster" // "raster" || "geojson"
    },
    …
],
```

[`DB` `dashboardmanager.component_maps`](/back-end/components-db)

In the database, map configs are stored separately in the `component_maps` table and joined with the `components` table during API calls.

> **i01**
> In Mapbox, each map type supports numerous paint properties that control visual details such as color, size, blur, etc. To customize a map beyond its default form, simply pass in any paint property supported by Mapbox. ([Mapbox layers docs](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/layers/))

> **w01**
> As the default color for all map types is black, the color paint property (e.g `fill-color`, `circle-color`, etc.) for all map types should ALWAYS be specified.

## Map Types

8 map types are supported in this project. Each map type has preset default styling applied which is listed in the file `mapConfig.js` located at `/src/assets/configs/mapbox`. Several maps also support preset variations to the default styling. This is achieved by specifying the size or icon parameters in the map config.

### Circle

The circle map type renders points as circles on the map. `Size` variations include `small` and `big`. `Icon` variations include `heatmap` which blurs the dots to create a heatmap-like effect when zoomed out.

### Fill

The fill map type renders polygons onto the map. There are no preset variations.

### Fill-extrusion

The fill-extrusion map type protrudes a 3D rendering of polygons from the map. There are no preset variations.

### Line

The line map type renders lines onto the map. `Size` variations include `wide`. `Icon` variations include `dash` which renders dashed lines instead of solid ones.

### Symbol

The symbol map type renders points as icons. For symbol maps, the `icon` parameter must be passed into the map config. Available icons include `metro`, `metro-density`, `triangle_green`, `triangle_white`, `youbike`, `bus`, and `cctv`.

### Arc

The arc map type renders lines as 3D arcs. Each line should only contain 2 points as any additional points wouldn't be rendered. The arc map type was custom built and as such only supports the following four paint properties:

```json
"paint": {
	"arc-color": ["#ffffff", "#f34523"], // Array of Strings;
	// Fill in 1 color code for single color arcs; 2 colors for a gradient arc
	"arc-width": 4, // Number
	"arc-opacity": 0.5, // Number; 0-1
	"arc-animate": true, // Boolean; Default is false
}
```

### Voronoi

The voronoi map type generates voronoi boundaries from points. The resulting map layer can be styled the same way as line maps (see above).

### Isoline

The isoline map type generates contour lines from points and their respective values. Each point must contain a property that is a number. The key of the property defaults to `value` but can be modified by passing in the `isoline-key` parameter (see below). The resulting map layer can be styled the same way as line maps (see above).

```json
"paint": {
	"isoline-key": "value", // null || String; Defaults to "value"
	"isoline-step": 2, // Number; The interval between lines. Default is 2
	"isoline-min": 0, // Number; Min value. Default is 0
	"isoline-max": 100, // Number; Max value. Default is 100
	// ...other line paint properties
}
```
