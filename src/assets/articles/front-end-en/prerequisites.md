> If you are new to front-end development, we recommend first familiarizing yourself with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before moving on to a web framework like Vue. [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/allcourses), [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) are all great resources for learning the basics of web development.
