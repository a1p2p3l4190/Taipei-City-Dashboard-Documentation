## Taipei Codefest 2023

Hey! Before you go any further, we would like to invite you to participate in an exciting hackathon event on Nov 18 - 19 this year. 

<img width="200" alt="Codefest_Black" src="https://github.com/tpe-doit/Taipei-City-Dashboard-FE/assets/13110501/29ebed08-a63d-4fd5-8bd5-e4c423f4e4d4">

Taipei Codefest is hosted by the Taipei City Government to promote and accelerate the open-source effort of Taipei City Dashboard. Contestants will attempt to create more than 4 new components for Taipei City Dashboard in 32 hours. With a top prize of NT$300,000 and unlimited food during the contest, this is definitely an opportunity you wouldn't want to miss. Check out more information on the hackathon's official site: https://codefest.taipei
