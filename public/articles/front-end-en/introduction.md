## About Taipei City Dashboard
Taipei City Dashboard is a data visualization platform developed by Taipei Urban Intelligence Center (TUIC). 

Our main goal was to create a comprehensive data visualization tool to assist in Taipei City policy decisions. This was achieved through the first version of the Taipei City Dashboard, which displayed a mix of internal and open data, seamlessly blending statistical and geographical data.

Since its launch in 2021, Taipei City Dashboard has played an important role in assisting Taipei City government officials make informed policy decisions. Learn more about how the idea for Taipei City Dashboard was developed and refined in [this article](https://tuic.gov.taipei/en/works/dashboard) on TUIC’s website.

## Our Dashboard, Made Yours
Fast forward to mid-2023, as Taipei City’s open data eco-system matured and expanded, our vision gradually expanded to not only aid policy decisions but also keep citizens informed about the important statistics of their city. Given the effectiveness of this tool, we also hoped to publicize the codebase for this project so that any relevant organization could easily create a similar data visualization tool of their own.

After months of discussions, refactoring, and development, we have completed Taipei City Dashboard’s transition to open-source. The data we gathered, the insights we gained, and the tools we developed, now all public. We are excited for this next chapter in Taipei City Dashboard’s journey and invite you all for the ride.

Our dashboard, made yours.
