## About Taipei City Dashboard
Taipei City Dashboard is a data visualization platform developed by Taipei Urban Intelligence Center (TUIC).

Our main goal is to create a comprehensive data visualization tool to assist in Taipei City policy decisions. This was achieved through the first version of the Taipei City Dashboard, which displayed a mix of internal and open data, seamlessly blending statistical and geographical data.

Since its launch in 2021, Taipei City Dashboard has played an important role in assisting Taipei City government officials in making informed policy decisions. Learn more about how the idea for Taipei City Dashboard was developed and refined in [this article](https://tuic.gov.taipei/en/works/dashboard) on TUIC’s website.

## Why Taipei City Dashboard
Taipei City Dashboard’s comprehensive yet simple and straightforward design sets it apart from similar data visualization platforms. It was built with the intent of encouraging cross-referencing across time and space, organizing datasets into modularized and integrated visual components.

Most of the data displayed in Taipei City Dashboard is from [data.taipei](https://data.taipei/), Taipei’s open data platform. We have provided data interpretation guides and suggested use cases for each dataset on the platform, allowing any user to fully leverage the possibilities of Taipei open data.

Taipei City Dashboard is the first open-sourced city dashboard that is not just for public showcasing. We have not only made the codebase for the platform public but also actively encourage collaboration in the development effort.

Whether you want to contribute to improving Taipei’s open data ecosystem or create your own data visualization tool, Taipei City Dashboard is a great place to start and build upon.

## Our Dashboard, Made Yours
Fast forward to mid-2023, as Taipei City’s open data ecosystem matured and expanded, our vision gradually expanded as well. We aimed not only to aid policy decisions but also to keep citizens informed about the important statistics of their city. Given the effectiveness of this tool, we also hoped to publicize the codebase for this project so that any relevant organization could easily create a similar data visualization tool of their own.

Our dashboard, made yours.

### Taipei City Dashboard 2.0
Based on the above vision, we decided to begin development on Taipei City Dashboard 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 will be a public platform instead of an internal tool. The codebase for Taipei City Dashboard will also be open-sourced, inviting all interested parties to participate in the development of this platform.

We have since completed the initial layouts and basic functionalities of Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 and feel the time is right to begin sharing the development process with the general public. From now on, you will be able to suggest features and changes to Taipei City Dashboard and develop the platform alongside us. We are excited for you to join Taipei City Dashboard’s journey!

## What to Expect from This Documentation
This documentation covers the front-end portion of the in-development Taipei City Dashboard 2.0. This documentation will go through every major aspect of this project, providing a thorough understanding of how this project works. 

>**i01**
>The front-end portion of the in-development Taipei City Dashboard 2.0 will henceforth be referred to as **“this project”** throughout the documentation.

>**w01**
>Due to its static and open-source nature, the project only includes the dashboard UI. The admin UI is and will not be provided.
>
>Regardless, we have taken steps to ensure that it will be easy to transform this project into a dynamic application. Check out our guide on the topic [here](/front-end/create-a-dynamic-application).

If you are interested in working with the codebase of this project in any way, it is recommended to read through the first four sections. The [first article in section 5](/front-end/customization-overview) will provide further suggestions on which subsequent articles to focus on, depending on how you would like to use this project.
