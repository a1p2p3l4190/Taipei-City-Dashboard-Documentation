## Become a Contributor
This project welcomes any contributions. We manage all of our contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/igorho2000/Taipei-City-Dashboard-Public) through issues and pull requests. 

Contributions are classified into the following three types: bug reports, feature requests, and new components. These contribution types will be explained in greater detail in this [later article](/front-end/open-an-issue). 

You may suggest changes by opening an issue on GitHub. If we approve the change, you may either choose to let us proceed with the development, or choose to implement the change yourself and then open a pull request when you are finished.
